                ABOUT ME
            </h2>
            <b>
                Hello, This is Huq
            </b>
            <p> 
                I am from Dhaka and I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at 
                <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/" target="_blank">BRAC University</a>. During my time in university, I explored various aspects of computer science, 
                including machine learning, artificial intelligence and web development. Among these, I 
                discovered a true passion for web design and Software Quality Assurance, which I'm excited to pursue as I
                embark on my career.
                <br>
                While studying, I also had the opportunity to participate in research projects, and I'm proud 
                to say that I co-authored several research papers. Two of these papers were even published in 
                2023 & 2024. I'm currently working on another exciting research project. My main area of interest 
                in research is Human-Computer Interface, a field I'm hoping to delve deeper into during my 
                postgraduate studies.
                <br>
                Beyond my academic interests, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I enjoy taking mobile 
                photography and experimenting with cartoon drawing, allowing me to express my creativity in 
                different ways. When I'm not busy with my studies or hobbies, you can often find me engaged 
                in online gaming, watching TV shows and anime, or enjoying the great outdoors. I'm particularly
                fond of cycling, which is not only a great way to stay active but also a fantastic way to clear 
                my mind and enjoy nature. My varied interests reflect my love for learning and experiencing new 
                things, and I'm excited to see where my journey in the world of web design and Human-Computer 
                Interface research takes me.
             </p>

             <b>
                The bio I hope you'll read!
            </b>
             <p>
                Meet Huq, the ultimate multitasker (when he's not procrastinating, that is)! 
                When he's not busy, procrastinating and finding new ways to avoid his responsibilities, you may find him 
                randomly thinking on how to solve the impossible equation of life, to get the meaning out of it or just 
                having a daydream. He is a late sleeping utopian that spends his free time binge-watching or 
                harassing flatmates with his late-night cooking experiments. If you have the opportunity to live 
                next-door to him, you may hear clatter & crackle from his kitchen in the midnight when owls should 
                have been hooting instead. While some consider him as an enigma or absolutely useless as a person, 
                he chooses to believe that he is a higher level Buddha of sorts with great plans and designs on the 
                founding of his surroundings & its people. Again, some mention him as a ‘সাধু-সন্ন্যাসী’ (monk) since he 
                stays inactive or randomly gets out of touch in social media messaging even though he is found really 
                proactive sharing memes. Among his friends he is the most calm person & also known as ‘Panda’, in 
                short which resembles both his physical size and lifestyle.
            </p>
